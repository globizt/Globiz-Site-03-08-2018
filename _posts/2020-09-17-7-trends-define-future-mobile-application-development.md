With over 1 billion smartphones and 180 billion mobile applications tracked annually, mobile development is certainly one of the newest and growing sectors.

&nbsp;

The mobile app market is obviously dominated by Google apps (Gmail, Maps, Search), social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube), and game apps (Angry Birds, Temple Run). Giants like Walmart, Bank of America, and Amazon use mobile apps to make branding, improve customer engagement, direct marketing, etc. Small and medium-sized businesses follow the mobile system.

Ultimately a successful mobile strategy involves more than just a portable website. <strong>Mobile app development</strong> is driven by technological advances that require businesses to have a vision for the next few years. Below are some trends that will determine the future of mobile app development.

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><strong> WEARABLE DEVICES</strong></li>
</ol>
Clothing brands such as the Apple Watch show the upcoming change in computers and the transition from basic to smart. This opens up new opportunities for marketers, application developers. The smartphone will be the centerpiece of a personal network that includes wearable gadgets such as body health sensors, smart jewelry, functional watches, display devices (such as Google Glass), and a variety of sensors embedded in clothing and footwear. These gadgets will interact with mobile applications to deliver information in new ways. It will also empower a variety of products and services in areas such as sports, fitness, fashion, hobbies, and health care. Therefore, wearable devices connected to smartphones will influence the next generation of mobile app development strategies.

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong> INTERNET OF THINGS AND MOBILE-CONNECTED SMART OBJECTS</strong></li>
</ol>
The smart home appliances will be part of the Internet of Things and will communicate via the App via smartphone or tablet. Smartphones and tablets will act as remote controls, display and analyze data, connect to social networks to monitor potential "items" to send or send, pay for subscription services, order non-returnable items, and update item firmware. Companies such as Microsoft, its Intelligent Systems Service, as well as enterprise software vendors such as SAP, and its Internet of Things Solutions, can also add power to the Internet of Things to their offerings.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong> M-COMMERCE</strong></li>
</ol>
Various analysts believe that good mobile shopping trends will continue over the next 4 years as more and more consumers adapt to m-commerce. The growing popularity of Apple Pay and Google Wallet will help make purchases using mobile phones instead of debit or credit cards. This will require developers to develop a mobile application that can process transactions without the need for debit/credit cards or cash. Combined with clothing that can process m-commerce payments will take a different turn. In addition to data collection and forecasting analytics, wearables will play an important role in the future of mobile payments and customer loyalty.

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong> MOTION AND LOCATION SENSING</strong></li>
</ol>
Most mobile phones have a local sensor that uses a variety of configurations to provide different communities of local data. Knowing a person's location within a few meters helps to provide information and services that are most relevant to the context. Mobility sensors are used for security, anti-theft, energy-saving, and games. Location sensations are helpful in Games, Vehicle planning, and fitness applications. Apps that exploit the internal environment are now using technologies such as Wi-Fi, imaging, ultrasonic beacons, and geomagnetic. It will be a technology that works as long as smart lighting will also be important. Direct indoor hearing, combined with <strong>mobile applications</strong>, will create a new generation of personalized and informative services.

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
 	<li><strong> INNOVATIVE MOBILE USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN</strong></li>
</ol>
Displaying data and active content on the mobile user interface is essential for meaningful user information. Successful mobile application companies, such as Instagram &amp; Pinterest, have created new patterns that reflect the precise design and interactive social media. Developers also create applications that can address mobile challenges, such as partial user attention and distraction.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong> APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (APM)</strong></li>
</ol>
There are two factors that lead to performance restrictions within the app namely the diversity of mobile devices and the ambiguous nature of mobile networks. However, mobile metrics and monitoring tools are known collectively as Application Performance Management (APM) have improved quality assurance and verification. APM provides visibility in-app behavior, delivers statistics on which devices, and monitors user behavior to determine which features of the app are being exploited successfully. With the use of landscape infrastructure and enterprise in the cloud, APM tools face the increased challenges of providing real-world performance benefits to all systems with visible perimeters. Current businesses need robust tools that can monitor applications used by applications, link that data to user identifiable information, and align performance with business processes.

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
 	<li><strong> ENTERPRISE MOBILE MANAGEMENT</strong></li>
</ol>
Business Mobile Business Management (EMM) is a collection of people, processes, and technologies using a mobile computer to facilitate businesses. The main focus of EMM is security, application management, and financial management. Includes mobile device management, mobile app management, app wrap and container installation, and other file sync and sharing features. Such tools will grow, expand in size, and ultimately address the various needs of mobile management across all popular Operating Systems on Smartphones, tablets, and PCs. EMM, therefore, represents the future emergence and integration of several mobile management, security, and support technologies.

&nbsp;

We cannot deny that <strong>mobile applications</strong> have become an integral part of the digital system. The skills needed to build consumer applications are more needed than ever for businesses to force them to take the journey seriously. Businesses should look at these trends to align their <a href="https://globiztechnology.com/mobile-application-development-services/"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> strategies.
