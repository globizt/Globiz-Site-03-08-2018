This is for the simple reason that merely having a website will not solve your purpose of gaining more traffic and ensuring conversions. Alongside, appreciable search engine visibility plays an equally important role to fulfill the intended cause.

Abiding by stats, A 2016 <a href="http://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-creating-content-is-most-effective-and-most-difficult-seo-tactic/430335/">MarketDive</a> report revealed that 82% respondents confirmed the rise in the effectiveness of SEO and 42% accepted a significant growth in its effectiveness.

These 8 points will help you to shortlist the most feasible SEO companies; you may then proceed to hire the best one.
<ol>
 	<li><strong> Sound SEO acumen</strong></li>
</ol>
The in-depth knowledge of all the SEO aspects is the foremost requirement to select a suitable SEO service company. The professionals at your chosen company must be well versed with on-page and off-page SEO, local search, analytics, keyword development, mobile optimization, link building and so on. Pay Per Click and Social Media Marketing are the other important verticals where the SEO company must excel.
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong> Proven expertise in all the SEO levels</strong></li>
</ol>
The structure of website is one of the foremost SEO aspects to decide if the search engines can crawl the website easily or with difficulty. Intelligent use of on-page optimization elements like keyword selection, HTML tags, and more, also work effectively to drive more traffic. Finally, link building techniques, which form an important part of Off-page optimization, are highly productive at ranking your site. Your shortlisted SEO companies should be dexterous in all these three SEO levels in order to help you get the desired search page rankings.
<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong> Understanding the client’s requirement</strong></li>
</ol>
While hiring a SEO company to spread the scoop about your business, you should make sure if the service provider is well adept at catering to the needs of your business. It should be able to identify the targeted audiences, make them your returning visitors through a foolproof SEO strategy and execute the intended deliverables accordingly.
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong>
Credible Work profile</strong></li>
</ol>
Just because a SEO service provider is good at ranking an e-commerce website, you can’t consider it reliable for a travel website or the one representing some other domain. All the fields have respective requirements and technical jargon that need proper understanding before taking up the projects. Hence, it is essential to cross-check the expertise of the concerned company in your industry.
<ul>
 	<li>For a better insight, browse through its website, know more about the SEO services it offers, read the testimonials of its previous and existing customers; the more testimonials the better.</li>
 	<li>Additionally, You can go through its track record to know whether it has extended its SEO services on a similar vertical before followed by the outcome, the satisfaction level of its client, and the business growth through its SEO efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
 	<li><strong> The content rules</strong></li>
</ol>
Be it off-page or on-page optimization, the role of content is invincible. If the SEO firm has an experienced in-house content team, it would therefore be a further plus. From writing web page content to Call-To-Actions, web blogs to SEO articles, and so on, quality content holds the key. Moreover, detailed keyword research with the help of advanced tools like Google analytics, SEMrush, wordstream, etc., could lead to the development of even superior grade content.
<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong>
Only White hat techniques please</strong></li>
</ol>
In the wake of gaining top rankings on Google, several SEO firms often head toward unethical black hat techniques. Prominent of these unavoidable methods include using duplicate content, keyword stuffed content, gaining backlinks from irrelevant sites, cloaking or redirecting the visitor to some other website, etc. Hence, you need to check if your shortlisted SEO companies are careful enough to avoid such negative tactics and replace them with relevant content, useful backlinks and meaningful page titles. Alongside, use of complete sentences, completely free from grammatical errors is another important necessity in this context.
<ol start="7">
 	<li><strong> Is it social media star?</strong></li>
</ol>
The presence on social media is a matter of prestige for everyone nowadays and the same holds for a SEO company as well.
<ul>
 	<li>Check out the profile pages of your shortlisted SEO organizations over popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.</li>
 	<li>Have a keen eye on their posts and tweets, to see if they hit social media regularly or occasionally.</li>
 	<li>The quality of content they post on these platforms also speaks volumes of the content they will provide for your website.</li>
 	<li>Also, make sure to go through the customer reviews and comments on these platforms to get an idea of the relevance of credibility of their services.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="8">
 	<li><strong> Budget constraints</strong></li>
</ol>
But obvious, the cost factor is of high importance in singling out the best SEO company. Depending on whether your goal is to get high traffic or more revenues, you could hire various services of the concerned SEO company. However, all good things come at a price tag, and the services from this industry are no different. Prefer the websites that show you the rate list of every SEO service they provide, because they have nothing to hide from you. The selection of a local or an overseas SEO provider could also make the difference to your budget, so choose wisely.
