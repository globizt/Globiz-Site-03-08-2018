Therefore, around 62% of businesses worldwide are going with a mobile app already or are in the process of making one.

Furthermore, Android OS is controlling almost 77% of the mobile devices including ubiquitous Smartphones.

The number of mobile app downloads-for that matter- is growing enormously. The expected number of downloads are likely to reach over 258 billion by 2022.
