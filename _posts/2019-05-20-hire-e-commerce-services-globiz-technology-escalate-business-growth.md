<strong>Cheap Mobile Data is a Fad Now: </strong>Massive fall in the price of mobile data has given a big rise in the number of consumers. And thanks to cheap data- now over 90% millennials are spending their free time on social media. So a range of products is being sold on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest etc. And the Marketplace is experimenting like anything to get even bigger.
